# where /dev/sg0 was the scsi_debug driver in a Linux system
#
# Later this file can be fully decoded like this:
#    sdparm -I sdp_sdeb_ahhhh.hex -a
# or the Caching mode page decoded with
#    sdparm -I sdp_sdeb_ahhhh.hex --page=ca
# or a single field fetched:
#    sdparm -I sdp_sdeb_ahhhh.hex --get=wce
# and many other variants.
